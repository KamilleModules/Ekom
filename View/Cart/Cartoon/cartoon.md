Cartoon
============
2017-12-09


The idea behind cartoon is to display the various representations of a cart using
only one object (with different parameters).




Intro
--------------
In ekom, the cart model, or part of it, is used at different key points: in the cart, in the checkout, 
in the customer invoices, in the customer orders, in the confirmation-order email that you send to your customer
when she/he successfully places an order, in a pdf invoice, ...

Hence, it would be useful if we had ONE tool (because one tool is faster to learn than many, admittedly)
to render this cart model.

So, Cartoon claims to be the official ekom' swiss army knife, as far as the cartModel rendering is concerned.
