Ekom mail
==============
2017-12-12


Ekom mail strategy is based on a simple pattern: you call only one function: sendMail.


```php
E::sendMail ( mailType, recipient, array variables=[] )
``` 



The different mail types, and their corresponding variables are:


- customer.new.validation
- ...

 
Actually, you can use the "tool-mail.php" script to visually the variables and the templates.
So, use this tool as the documentation.
