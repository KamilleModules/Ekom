Order and invoices
======================
2017-12-03


When the customer puts items in his cart, he doesn't have to be aware that each of those products are sold by an 
"administrative" entity called seller.


However, the money collected by the customer's purchase(s) is precisely collected by those sellers.

The seller wants an invoice for legal/organizational reasons.


So, when the cart contains multiple items provided by different sellers, even though the user doesn't care,
each seller still want their own invoices.


And so that's why the same order can be dispatched into any number of invoices, one per seller.


So when ekom creates an order, you always have at least one invoice attached to it.
