Product details
===================
2017-09-19



Product details is an extension of the ekom attributes system.

Where attributes combinations give us unique product ids, product details allow us
to go even deeper and reflect more complex products.


Product details are such as if you pass the product details in the uri, 
the product page will reflect them no matter what.

(This feature is necessary so that a user can browse her purchased products history and land
on the desired product pages if necessary.)



We can divide product details in two groups:

- major product details
- minor product details


Major product details provoke a change of the token (see cart.md for more info about token).
Minor product details DO NOT provoke a change of the token.


In other words, not all product details change the product instance that you add in your cart.
Those minor product details are instead used to configure further a product instance.


This is what led us to distinguish two types of product instances (see cart again).
