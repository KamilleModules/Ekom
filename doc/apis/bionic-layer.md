Bionic layer
==================
2017-11-10



The bionic layer is a js tool that connects your template to the ekom js api automatically.


This works by simply using naming conventions.


To give you the idea, imagine that you create a div element in your template, like this:


```html
<div class="bionic-product-id" data-id="6"></div>
```  


With this kind of markup, by simply adding the **bionic.js** layer on top 
of any template, we can detect that the product id is 6 (for instance).


By extending this idea, we can get all kind of behaviours automated for us,
simply by using some naming conventions.




This is a work in progress...
